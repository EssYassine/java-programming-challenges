# Challenge 4: Parsing Export Data

## Problem Description

In this challenge, you will write a Java program to analyze and extract information from a CSV file containing export data of various countries. The program will read the dataset, parse the data, and filter countries based on specific conditions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:

- Learn how to read and parse CSV files in Java.
- Understand how to extract and process structured data using the CSVParser class.
- Gain experience in filtering and searching data based on multiple conditions.
- Practice implementing custom helper methods to modularize code.
- Develop skills in string manipulation and pattern matching within structured data.

## Input/Output Specification

### Input

- A CSV file containing export data, where each row represents a country and its exports.
- Example CSV format:

```bash
Country,Exports,Value (dollars)
Argentina,Gold; Silver; Copper,$1,234,567,890
Brazil,Oil; Gold,$987,654,321
Canada,Diamonds; Silver,$500,000,000
```

### Output

- A list of countries based on filtering criteria (e.g., countries that export a specific product).
- The total number of countries meeting a given condition.
- Formatted information for selected countries.

## Hints & Considerations

- Use CSVParser from the Apache Commons CSV library (available in Dukeâ€™s Java environment).
- Be mindful of cases where countries export multiple products, separated by semicolons (;).
- Handle edge cases, such as :
  - Countries with no listed exports.
  - Countries with exports containing spaces or mixed casing.
  - Large numbers formatted with commas.

## Approach

1. Read the CSV file using CSVParser.
2. Loop through each row and extract the country name, export items, and value.
3. Filter data based on conditions (e.g., countries exporting a specific product).
4. Format and display results, handling any special cases in output formatting.

## Example

### Input

```java
String exportItem = "Gold";
printCountriesWithExport(exportItem);
```

### Output

```less
Countries that export Gold:
- Argentina (Exports: Gold; Silver; Copper, Value: $1,234,567,890)
- Brazil (Exports: Oil; Gold, Value: $987,654,321)
```

## Final Notes

- Test the program with different export items to verify filtering works correctly.
- Extend functionality to count and print total matching countries.
- Consider adding multiple filtering criteria, such as minimum export value.
