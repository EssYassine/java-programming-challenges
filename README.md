## Course Overview

This course covers a variety of topics including:

- Developing strong problem-solving skills
- Translating real-world problems into efficient and reusable code using Java
- Breaking down problems into manageable steps and implementing solutions

Through hands-on coding challenges, you'll gain practical experience in algorithmic thinking, data structures, and applying Java to real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course module. Each module contains:

- A folder with problem descriptions (in `.md` format)
- A folder for Java solution files (in a BlueJ project `.bluej`)

### Folder Structure

### `Module-X/`

Each module includes:

- **`problem/`**: containing a `Challenge-X.md` file describing the problem to be solved.
- **`solutions/`**: This folder contains the BlueJ file and Java code that provides my solution to the challenge.

### `.gitignore`

A standard `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.

### `LICENSE`

The license file for open-source use.

### `README.md`

The main documentation file providing an overview of the repository, guidelines, and instructions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-problem-solving.git
   cd java-problem-solving
   ```

2. Explore the challenges in the Module-X folders and read the descriptions in the \*.md files.

3. Open the blueJ file in the solutions/Module-X folders and run the code on your local machine.

4. You can also add your own solutions, improvements, or tests by creating new Java files in the appropriate module folder.

5. If you make any modifications, don't forget to push your changes to your fork or contribute via a pull request.
